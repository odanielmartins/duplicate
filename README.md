# duplicate
A small PHP script to remove empty and duplicate files from a directory tree.<BR />
Example of use:<BR />
php -f duplicate.php C:\PHOTOS<BR />
Will erase all empty and duplicate photos and other files.<BR />
We have not tested in a Linux environement where "/" is used instead of "\".<BR \>
Of course you must have an PHP interpreter installed.<BR />
WeÂ´d love to receive feedbacks and please make a backup of your tree directory<BR />
before trying to use this script just in case.
